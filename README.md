# Overview

We are building a peer-to-peer car rental service. Let's call it Drivly :)

Here is our plan:

- Let any car owner list her car on our platform.
- Let any person (let's call him 'driver') book a car for a given period and an approximate distance.

## Tasks

Your task is to develop one (or more, feel free) RESTful service(s) to:

The car owner chooses a price per day and price per km for her car. The driver then books the car for a given period and an approximate distance.

The rental price is the sum of:

- A time component: the number of rental days multiplied by the car's price per day.
- A distance component: the number of km multiplied by the car's price per km.

Download the sample data (input.json and output.json) to make your task easier.

## Non-functional requirements

Your service(s) must be resilient, fault tolerant, and responsive. You should prepare it/them to be highly scalable as possible.

## Deliverables

The following deliverables are mandatory for the test acceptance:

- Source code in a public git repository.
- Instructions for configuring and running the application.

If you think something is really necessary, but you donâ€™t have enough time to implement, please explain how you would implement it.

Good luck!
